This file documents the awe32Check() function. It can be found in
the independent AWECHECK.OBJ module.


IMPORTANT: If auto-detection is needed, developers are advised to use
the function to detect the presence of the EMU8000 wavetable engine.
This is because the base I/O address of EMU8000 is no longer guaranteed
to be at 0x400 offfset to the 0x2X0 SoundBlaster 16 base address.


The prototype of the function is as follow:

    WORD
    PASCAL awe32Check(WORD   wBaseAddx,
                      DWORD* pdwRomId,
                      DWORD* pdwRomVer,
                      DWORD* pdwDramSize)

    where
    1. wBaseAddx refers to the base I/O address of EMU8000
    2. pdwRomId is a pointer to a DWORD where ROM ID will be stored
    3. pdwRomVer is a pointer to a DWORD where ROM version number
       will be stored
    4. pdwDramSize is a pointer to a DWORD where the size of all
       available RAM will be stored

The function detects the presence of EMU8000, gets the ROM ID & ROM
version number, and detects the available RAM. If the EMU8000 is
present awe32Check returns zero. Current SB AWE32's ROM ID is
0x4d474d31 and ROM version is 0x20008. The supplied presets (EMBED.OBJ),
is made specifically for this ROM ID only. The RAM size is in term of
the number of 16bit samples.

The ROM ID and ROM version number are provided for information purposes
only. Applications should not rely on them for their thread of
executions.
