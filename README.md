# DDEML
The program implements a dialog in Windows using the DDE protocol in client mode (during operation, the program uses resources and functions from various DLLs). Developed in the Borland Delphi 7.0 system.

To create a resource file, use brc32.exe
 
Command:   brc32 -r <filename>.rc

The -r option cancels the immediate inclusion of the resource file in the executable module. 

The repository also contains an executable server file for conducting tests of the developed client module. If necessary, I can post a similar "test" executable module for the client.

Developed by Saffox.
